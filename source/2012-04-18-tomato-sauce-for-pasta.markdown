title: Tomato sauce for pasta

## Ingredients

- Sherry Vinegar
- Salt, Pepper
- 1 large onion
- 1 can chopped tomatoes with basil
- 2 Cloves garlic

## Method

Chop the onion as finely as you can and set aside. Crush the garlic and finely chop (or use a garlic mincer) and add to the chopped onions.

Heat a table spoon of olive oil in a large frying pan or wok and add the onions and garlic. Gently cook until they soften and smell good. Add the tin of chopped tomatoes and then half-fill the empty tomatoes can with water, swirl to get the left over tomato sauce from the can and add this to the cooking onions.

Add salt, pepper and sherry vinegar to taste (I like a very generous splash of vinegar) and then simmer until the sauce has reduced (you can have it as thick or as thin as you like).

Server over pasta.

## Magic Extras

Try adding 250-500g of lean minced beef once the onions are cooked and before adding the tomatoes. This mix can be served over pasta or used to go in a lasagne.

Cook meatballs and cover in sauce.

Grate an Italian hard cheese to the top of your food for extra yumminess.
