## Ingredients

- Sherry Vinegar
- Salt, Pepper
- 1 large onion
- 1 can chopped tomatoes with basil
- 2 Cloves garlic

## Method

Chop the onion as finely as you can and set aside. Crush and finely chop the garlic (or use a garlic mincer). Add to the chopped onions.

Heat a table spoon of olive oil in a large frying pan or wok and add the onions and garlic. Gently cook until the onions have softened and smell good. Add the tin of chopped tomatoes and then half-fill the empty can with water, swirl to get the left over tomato sauce from the can and add this to the wok.

Add salt, pepper and sherry vinegar to taste (I like a very generous splash of vinegar) and then simmer until the sauce has reduced.

Serve over pasta.

## Magic Extras

Try adding 250-500g of lean minced beef as soon as the onions are cooked but before adding the tomatoes. This mix can be served over pasta or used in a lasagne.

Serve over meatballs.

Grate an Italian hard cheese to the top of your food for extra yumminess.
