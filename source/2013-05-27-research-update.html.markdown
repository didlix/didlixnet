A few weeks ago I launched a research project to analyse how people protect their smartphones with the aim of prototyping an app to help emergency services staff identify people in crisis.

This research has received an reception and has already had 492 people submit their information. Our current plan is to continue to promote the survey, aiming to get to 1000 responses in within the next 4 months. Additionally, we want to interview emergency services staff about their ability to find out information about patients, both when on and off duty. This will provide us with the information to design another survey, targeted at the emergency services to provide useful additional information.

Our plan is to take all of this research to NHS Hack Day 5 in four months time, present a summary of the problem, the data and then invite participants to help develop a prototype.

If this project interests you, please do contact me. You can findout more about the research, and more about NHS Hack Days.
