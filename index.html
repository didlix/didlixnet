<p>Hello!</p>

<p>By night I am a Human-Centred Systems MSc student at City University London. By day, a Senior Software Engineer.</p>

<p>I am presently looking for full-time contract opportunities. Feel free to check out my <a href="cv.html">CV</a> and <a href="mailto:hello@didlix.net">get in touch</a>.</p>

<p> As part of my studies I am interested in conducting user research, information architecture and interaction design for projects in healthcare.</p>
