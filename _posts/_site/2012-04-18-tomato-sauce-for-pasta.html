<ul>
  <li>Sherry Vinegar</li>
  <li>Salt, Pepper</li>
  <li>1 large onion</li>
  <li>1 can chopped tomatoes with basil</li>
  <li>2 Cloves garlic</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="method">Method</h2>

<p>Chop the onion as finely as you can and set aside. Crush and finely chop the garlic (or use a garlic mincer). Add to the chopped onions.</p>

<p>Heat a table spoon of olive oil in a large frying pan or wok and add the onions and garlic. Gently cook until the onions have softened and smell good. Add the tin of chopped tomatoes and then half-fill the empty can with water, swirl to get the left over tomato sauce from the can and add this to the wok.</p>

<p>Add salt, pepper and sherry vinegar to taste (I like a very generous splash of vinegar) and then simmer until the sauce has reduced.</p>

<p>Serve over pasta.</p>

<h2 id="magic-extras">Magic Extras</h2>

<p>Try adding 250-500g of lean minced beef as soon as the onions are cooked but before adding the tomatoes. This mix can be served over pasta or used in a lasagne.</p>

<p>Serve over meatballs.</p>

<p>Grate an Italian hard cheese to the top of your food for extra yumminess.</p>
